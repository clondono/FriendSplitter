// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files

// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the

// # Note: Rails uses the gem turbolinks to handle redirects,
// #       so in order to rerun code on a redirect, the "page:change"
// #       method is needed as well as the onReady. A better way to 
// #       implement  this (in order to not repeat code) is to create a 
// #       function with the code and simply call the function 
// #       from both listeners.
// #       However, for some reason, it wouldn't execute the code.
